# Designs

This file contains links to a series of designs that were written during the course of RukPak development. Most design
documents are written using HackMD, and then shared here. These design docs provide further context on the features and
behavior of RukPak.

The docs themselves may be out slightly out of date, but are still useful in understanding the project. For example, the
BundleDeployment Kind was previously named BundleInstance.
