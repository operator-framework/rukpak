# Registry Bundle Spec

## Overview

This document is meant to define the `registry` bundle format as a reference for those publishing `registry` bundles
for use with RukPak. For more information on the concept of a bundle, click [here](https://github.com/operator-framework/rukpak#bundle).

The `registry+v1` bundles, or `registry` bundles, contains a set of static Kubernetes YAML
manifests organized in the legacy Operator Lifecycle Manger (OLM) format. For more information on the `registry+v1` format, see
the [OLM packaging doc](https://olm.operatorframework.io/docs/tasks/creating-operator-manifests/).
