                        --- Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources
                        like Available, but because arbitrary conditions can be useful
                        (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is
                        important. The regex it matches is (dns1123SubdomainFmt/)?(qualifiedNameFmt)
